# ðŸ§ª Password Cracking Lab

## Objective
Demonstrate how weak passwords can be cracked.

## Tools
- John the Ripper
- Hashcat

## Tasks
1. Generate a password hash (MD5/SHA1).
2. Use dictionary attack with common passwords.
3. Attempt brute force with limited charset.
4. Compare success rates.

## Defense
- Enforce strong password policies.
- Implement MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).
- Use bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 for hashing.
